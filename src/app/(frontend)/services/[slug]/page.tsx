      { question: 'How quickly can engineers be onboarded?', answer: 'Because we maintain a deep bench of vetted, senior engineering talent, we can typically present 2–3 pre-screened candidates within 72 hours and have an engineer fully onboarded within 2 weeks.' },
      { question: 'Do the engineers work in our timezone and within our tools?', answer: 'Yes. Our augmented engineers integrate fully into your existing workflows — your Slack, your Jira, your CI/CD pipeline. They work within your sprint cycles and report directly to your team leads.' },
      { question: 'What is the difference between staff augmentation and a managed team?', answer: 'Staff augmentation places individual engineers directly under your management — ideal when you need to extend your capacity. A managed team (dedicated pod) provides a fully self-sufficient team with a tech lead who owns delivery outcomes independently.' },
      { question: 'Can we hire the engineers permanently after the contract?', answer: 'Yes. We offer contract-to-hire engagements. If an augmented engineer is a great fit for your team culture and technical needs, we facilitate a transparent transition to a permanent employment arrangement.' },

      { question: 'What is the difference between UI and UX design?', answer: 'UX (User Experience) design focuses on the overall flow, information architecture, and how a user navigates through your product to achieve their goal.
